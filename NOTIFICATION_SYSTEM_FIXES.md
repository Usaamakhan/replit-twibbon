# FCM Notification System - Critical Fixes

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED & ARCHITECT REVIEWED

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing a critical bug where:
1. ‚úÖ First notification was received successfully
2. ‚ùå Device token was automatically removed from database after first notification
3. ‚ùå No subsequent notifications could be received
4. ‚ùå Settings toggle appeared enabled but notifications didn't arrive (confusing UX)

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Indiscriminate Token Removal**
The send API was removing ALL failed tokens, including those with temporary/transient errors (network issues, rate limits, server unavailable).

**Industry Standard:** Only remove tokens for **permanent failures** (invalid token, unregistered token), NOT temporary failures.

### 2. **Missing Token Re-registration**
The `useFCM` hook retrieved existing tokens from cache but didn't re-register them with the server, so server-side deletions were never restored.

### 3. **Canonical Token Update Issues**
Firebase returns canonical (updated) tokens for better delivery, but the system wasn't handling these updates properly, leading to:
- Race conditions in batch operations
- Duplicate writes causing batch failures
- Tokens remaining outdated

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Smart Token Cleanup** (`/api/notifications/send/route.js`)

**Permanent Errors (REMOVE TOKEN):**
- `messaging/invalid-registration-token`
- `messaging/registration-token-not-registered`
- `messaging/invalid-argument`
- `messaging/mismatched-credential`
- `messaging/authentication-error`

**Transient Errors (RETAIN TOKEN):**
- `messaging/server-unavailable`
- `messaging/internal-error`
- `messaging/unavailable`
- `messaging/quota-exceeded`
- `messaging/third-party-auth-error`

**Unknown Errors:** Retained for safety (logged for monitoring)

### 2. **Canonical Token Handling** (`/api/notifications/send/route.js`)

**Fixed Implementation:**
- Deduplicates by canonical (new) token, not old token
- Groups all old tokens mapping to same canonical
- Ensures each canonical token written only ONCE per batch
- Uses `merge: true` for graceful handling of pre-existing tokens
- Deletes ALL old tokens in same atomic operation

**Prevents:**
- Batch write conflicts (duplicate document writes)
- Race conditions during token updates
- Data loss during canonical upgrades

### 3. **Token Re-registration** (`src/hooks/useFCM.js`)

**New Behavior:**
- When existing token is retrieved from cache, it's immediately re-registered with server
- Updates `lastUsed` timestamp
- Ensures server-side persistence even if token was deleted
- Prevents desync between client and server token state

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**

**Added Comprehensive Logging:**
- ‚úÖ Success confirmations with token counts
- üìù Canonical token updates with before/after info
- üóëÔ∏è Permanent token removals with reasons
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transient errors (retained for retry)
- üìä Detailed metrics in API responses

## Expected Outcomes

‚úÖ **Devices persist after first notification**  
‚úÖ **Tokens survive transient network/server errors**  
‚úÖ **Canonical token updates handled properly**  
‚úÖ **Better error monitoring and debugging**  
‚úÖ **Settings page accurately reflects device status**  
‚úÖ **Toggle button state matches actual notification capability**

## API Response Format (Updated)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "successCount": 1,
  "failureCount": 0,
  "tokensRemoved": 0,
  "tokensUpdated": 0,
  "transientErrors": 0,
  "message": "Sent 1 notifications, 0 failed (0 tokens removed, 0 transient errors)"
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Send multiple notifications to same user** - Verify device persists
2. **Test during network issues** - Verify tokens retained for transient errors
3. **Monitor canonical updates** - Check logs for token upgrade paths
4. **Verify settings page** - Confirm device list stays accurate
5. **Test toggle behavior** - Ensure UI state matches functionality

## Future Enhancements (Suggested by Architect)

1. **Regression Tests:** Add unit/integration tests for duplicate canonical responses
2. **Backwards Compatibility:** Add fallback to document IDs if `token` field missing
3. **Monitoring:** Track metrics around canonical upgrades under load
4. **Retry Logic:** Implement automatic retry for transient errors

## Architecture Review

‚úÖ **Architect Approved** - All critical issues resolved:
- No race conditions in canonical token handling
- No duplicate writes in batch operations
- Proper error classification and handling
- Safe token lifecycle management
