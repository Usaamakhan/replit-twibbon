**Last Updated:** October 23, 2025

This document tracks known issues and suggested improvements for the Twibbonize reporting system. All issues are explained in simple, non-technical language so anyone can understand them.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Issues

### 5. **No Reminder for Appeal Deadlines**

**What's the problem?**
When a campaign is removed or user is banned, they have 30 days to appeal. But the system doesn't remind them as the deadline approaches.

**What does this mean?**
Users might forget to appeal until it's too late.

**Example:**
- User gets banned on January 1st
- They have until January 31st to appeal
- On January 30th (1 day left), no reminder is sent
- User forgets and misses the deadline
- Content is permanently deleted

**Impact:**
- Users miss their appeal window
- More angry users claiming the system is unfair
- Support team has to deal with "I missed the deadline" requests
- Could lead to users feeling the platform doesn't give them a fair chance

**Best solution:**
Send automatic reminders:
- **7 days before deadline:** "Reminder: You have 7 days left to appeal"
- **3 days before deadline:** "Reminder: You have 3 days left to appeal"  
- **1 day before deadline:** "Final reminder: Appeal deadline is tomorrow"

**Note:**
This requires a scheduled job (cron job) that runs daily to check appeal deadlines and send reminders.

### 6. **Appeal System Shows Deadlines But Can't Actually Appeal**

**What's the problem?**
When a user is banned or their campaign is removed, the system:
- Sets a 30-day appeal deadline
- Sends a notification saying "You can appeal until [date]"
- But there's no actual way to submit an appeal!

**What does this mean?**
Users are promised they can appeal, but when they try to find how, there's nothing there.

**Example:**
User gets notification: "Your campaign has been removed. You can appeal until February 20."
User thinks: "Okay, let me appeal"
User searches for appeal button: **Nothing found**
User gets frustrated: "They said I could appeal but there's no way to do it!"

**Impact:**
- User frustration (promised feature doesn't exist)
- Misleading notifications
- Support tickets from confused users
- Platform looks unprofessional
- Database fields (`appealDeadline`, `appealCount`) are set but never used

**Where in code:**
- `src/app/api/admin/reports/summary/[summaryId]/route.js` (lines 127, 133)

**Best solution:**
Three options:
- **Option 1:** Build the complete appeals system (see TASKS.md Section 9.2 for details)
- **Option 2:** Remove appeal references from notifications and stop setting appealDeadline/appealCount
- **Option 3:** Add a placeholder appeal page that says "Appeals system coming soon - contact support@example.com for urgent cases"

**Recommendation:** Option 3 as a quick fix, then implement Option 1 later.

## üí° Suggestions for Improvements

### 8. **Missing Status Transition Validation**

**What's the problem?**
The system doesn't check if status changes make sense. An admin could accidentally restore something that should stay permanently deleted.

**Example scenarios:**
- A campaign with `removed-permanent` status could be restored to `active` by dismissing reports
- A `banned-permanent` user could be warned and become `active` again
- No check prevents invalid state transitions

**What does this mean?**
"Permanent" removals/bans aren't actually permanent if admin clicks wrong button.

**Impact:**
- Business rules not enforced (permanent doesn't mean permanent)
- Potential for data integrity issues
- Confusing for admins (what does "permanent" mean if it can be reversed?)

**Best solution:**
Add status transition validation in the admin action endpoint:

```javascript
// Define valid transitions
const VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
  'active': ['under-review-hidden', 'removed-temporary', 'banned-temporary'],
  'under-review-hidden': ['active', 'removed-temporary', 'banned-temporary'],
  'removed-temporary': ['active', 'removed-permanent'],
  'banned-temporary': ['active', 'banned-permanent'],
  'removed-permanent': [], // Cannot transition out
  'banned-permanent': [], // Cannot transition out
};

// Check before updating
if (!VALID_TRANSITIONS[currentStatus].includes(newStatus)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid status transition');
}
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

**Last reviewed:** October 23, 2025

**Status Field Naming Convention:**
The codebase uses different field names for campaigns vs users intentionally:
- **Campaigns:** `moderationStatus` (tracks content moderation state: active, removed, etc.)
- **Users:** `accountStatus` (tracks account access state: active, banned, etc.)

This is **correct and should be kept** because:
‚úÖ They represent different concepts (content moderation vs account access)
‚úÖ Prevents field name conflicts when handling both types in the same code
‚úÖ Makes code more readable and semantically accurate
‚úÖ Consistent usage throughout the entire codebase

**Report System Architecture:**
The system uses **aggregated report summaries** instead of individual report documents:
- Main collection: `reportSummary` (aggregates all reports for a target)
- Legacy collection: `reports` (individual reports - still exists but unused)
- Performance: 96% reduction in database operations using batch `getAll()` queries
- Reason counts stored as objects: `{spam: 8, inappropriate: 5, copyright: 2}`

**Rate Limiting & Security:**
- Maximum 5 reports per hour per IP address
- Duplicate prevention: tracks both IP address AND userId for authenticated users
- IP addresses are **SHA-256 hashed** before storage (never stored raw)
- Stored in Firestore `reportRateLimits` collection with 24-hour TTL
- Auto-cleanup prevents database bloat

**Hybrid Notification System:**
- **In-app notifications:** Used for warnings, campaign removals, auto-hides, content restorations
- **Email notifications:** Used exclusively for ban/unban actions (critical for users who cannot access their account)
- All notification templates use object destructuring to prevent parameter order issues
- Typed confirmation ("CONFIRM") required for all dangerous admin actions

**Admin Accountability:**
- All admin actions logged to `adminLogs` Firestore collection
- Tracks: admin ID/email/name, action type, target, reason, timestamp
- Admin logs page available at `/admin/logs` with comprehensive filters
- Audit trail for all moderation decisions
