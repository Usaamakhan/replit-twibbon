## ðŸ“§ Email Notification System Issues


### 3. âœ… FIXED - Redundant Email Notifications for Campaign Appeal Reminders

**Issue:** Campaign creators were receiving BOTH in-app notifications AND emails for appeal deadline reminders, which was excessive since they can log in.

**Fix Applied:** Removed email sending for campaign appeal reminders. Now only sends in-app notifications.

**Current Behavior:**
- Campaign removals: Only in-app notification (lines 60-68) - creators can log in âœ…
- Account bans: Only email (lines 100-113) - users can't log in âœ…

**Rationale:**
- Campaign creators can log in â†’ see in-app notifications
- Banned users cannot log in â†’ need email to know about appeals

**Location:** `src/app/api/cron/send-appeal-reminders/route.js`, lines 59-71

**Date Fixed:** October 29, 2025
