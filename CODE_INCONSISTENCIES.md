**Review Scope:** Complete codebase audit - admin pages, API routes, reporting/appeal flows, cron jobs

## ðŸ“Š SUMMARY

**Total Issues:** 0 unfixed issues

All previously identified low-priority issues have been resolved.

**By Priority:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Low: 0 issues

**Recently Fixed (October 27, 2025):**
- âœ… **React Hook Missing Dependencies** - Added useCallback wrappers and proper dependency arrays in 6 files (appeals, adjust, campaign pages, campaigns list, creators list). Fixed stale closure issues and removed unnecessary dependencies.
- âœ… **Using <img> Instead of Next.js <Image /> Component** - Migrated appropriate `<img>` tags to Next.js `<Image />` component in 4 files (appeals, campaign, result pages). Strategically kept base64/blob preview images as `<img>` tags since they don't benefit from Next.js optimization.
- âœ… Missing Field Validation in Cron Jobs - Added proper validation for campaign.title, removalReason, username, and banReason
- âœ… Missing Error Handling for appealDeadline Conversion - Added try-catch blocks with fallback handling
- âœ… Cron Job Logging Missing Target Titles - Added targetTitle parameter to all logAdminAction calls
- âœ… Legacy "banned" Boolean Field Redundancy - Removed all references to legacy `banned` field, now using only `accountStatus` enum

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS

**All identified code quality and performance issues have been resolved.** The codebase now follows React best practices with proper hook dependencies and utilizes Next.js Image optimization where appropriate.

**Design Decisions:**
- Base64 data URLs and blob URLs remain as `<img>` tags (preview images in create/frame and create/background pages, composed images in result page) since Next.js Image doesn't optimize these sources.
- External image URLs from Supabase/Firebase storage now use Next.js `<Image />` component with proper sizing and optimization.
