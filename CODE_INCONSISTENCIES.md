## Admin System - Issues & Recommendations

### âœ… Resolved Issues

#### 1. Incomplete Status Color Helper Function [FIXED]
**Location:** `src/utils/admin/adminHelpers.js` (line 42-64)  
**Fixed Date:** October 31, 2025

**Issue:** The `getModerationStatusColor()` function was missing support for several statuses that are actively used in the system.

**Missing Statuses (Now Added):**
- âœ… `under-review-hidden` - Used when campaigns have 3+ reports or users have 10+ reports
- âœ… `removed-temporary` - Used for campaigns with 30-day appeal window
- âœ… `removed-permanent` - Used for permanent campaign removals
- âœ… `banned-temporary` - Used for temporarily banned users
- âœ… `banned-permanent` - Used for permanently banned users
- âœ… `deleted` - Used when target is deleted but summary exists

**Solution Applied:**
Updated the function to include all missing status values with appropriate color coding:
- Orange for `under-review-hidden` (moderate severity)
- Red for temporary removals/bans (high severity)
- Darker red for permanent removals/bans (critical severity)
- Gray for deleted items (neutral)

**Impact:** Admin components (`GroupedReportsTable`, `CampaignModerationCard`) now display accurate, color-coded status badges for all moderation states, improving admin visibility and workflow efficiency.
