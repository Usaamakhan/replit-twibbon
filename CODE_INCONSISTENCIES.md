# Code Inconsistencies & Documentation Gaps

**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025

This document tracks inconsistencies between documentation (CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM.md, TASKS.md, CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md) and actual codebase implementation.

---

## ‚úÖ Documentation Fixed (October 13, 2025)

### 1. CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md Updates
**Issues Found:**
- ‚ùå `ReportUserModal.js` was documented but doesn't exist
- ‚ùå `ShareModal.js` exists but wasn't documented
- ‚ùå `ReportModal.js` was documented but its dual purpose wasn't clear
- ‚ùå Notification system documentation was outdated (marked as "UI Integration Pending" when most UI is complete)
- ‚ùå `/profile/notifications` was described as "notification preferences" but it's actually a full inbox
- ‚ùå `/settings/notifications` wasn't documented properly

**Fixes Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Removed reference to non-existent `ReportUserModal.js`
- ‚úÖ Added `ShareModal.js` documentation (universal modal for campaigns and profiles)
- ‚úÖ Updated `ReportModal.js` description to clarify it handles both campaign and user reports
- ‚úÖ Updated FCM notification system status to reflect actual implementation
- ‚úÖ Corrected `/profile/notifications` description as "notification inbox with read/unread status and history"
- ‚úÖ Added `/settings/notifications` with complete feature list
- ‚úÖ Updated notification components status with accurate completion state

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Features Correctly Marked as Pending

### 1. Appeals System - NOT IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ Correctly Documented
**Documentation Status:**

**Status:** Documentation is accurate

---

### 3. Auto-Deletion Cron Jobs - NOT IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ Correctly Documented
**Documentation Status:** TASKS.md Section "Phase 5" says "‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED" ‚úÖ Correct

**Verification:**

- ‚ùå Temporary removals require manual admin cleanup

**Status:** Documentation is accurate, manual cleanup is current approach

---

### 4. Automated Notification Permission Prompting - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Documentation Status:** Should be documented as pending

**What's Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ `NotificationPermissionModal.js` component exists
- ‚úÖ `NotificationBanner.js` component exists
- ‚úÖ All FCM infrastructure complete
- ‚úÖ Settings page to manually enable

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå No automated trigger to show `NotificationPermissionModal` (e.g., after first campaign creation)
- ‚ùå No automatic display of `NotificationBanner` on dashboard
- ‚ùå No onboarding flow integration
- ‚ùå Components exist but aren't being used automatically

**Status:** Modal components exist but automated prompting strategy is not implemented

---

## üîç Actual Implementation Status (October 13, 2025)

### FCM Notification System - MOSTLY COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Backend (100% Complete):**
- ‚úÖ Token management APIs (`/api/notifications/register-token`, `/api/notifications/remove-token`)
- ‚úÖ Send notification API (`/api/notifications/send`)
- ‚úÖ Notification history APIs (`/api/notifications/[notificationId]` - PATCH/DELETE)
- ‚úÖ Service worker route (`/firebase-messaging-sw/route.js`)
- ‚úÖ Notification templates (`notificationTemplates.js`)
- ‚úÖ All admin actions trigger notifications
- ‚úÖ Notifications saved to Firestore for inbox

**Frontend UI (95% Complete):**
- ‚úÖ `useFCM()` hook - token management & foreground handling
- ‚úÖ `NotificationProvider.js` - global provider integrated in layout
- ‚úÖ `NotificationToast.js` - foreground toast display
- ‚úÖ `NotificationBell.js` - header icon with unread count
- ‚úÖ `NotificationBanner.js` - dashboard banner component
- ‚úÖ `NotificationPermissionModal.js` - permission request modal
- ‚úÖ `/profile/notifications` - full inbox page with read/unread, delete
- ‚úÖ `/settings/notifications` - full settings page with:
  - FCM device management
  - Per-notification-type preferences (localStorage)
  - Enable/disable toggle

**What's Pending (5%):**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Automated prompting strategy:
  - When to show `NotificationPermissionModal`?
  - When to show `NotificationBanner`?
  - Integration into user flows (e.g., after first campaign creation)

**Recommendation:** Update TASKS.md and CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM.md to reflect 95% completion with only automated prompting pending.

## üìã Component Discrepancies Resolved

### ‚úÖ Fixed Discrepancies

1. **ReportUserModal.js** ‚ùå Does NOT Exist
   - Documentation claimed it exists at `src/components/ReportUserModal.js`
   - **Reality:** `ReportModal.js` handles both campaign and user reports via `type` prop
   - **Fix:** Removed from documentation, clarified `ReportModal.js` is universal

2. **ShareModal.js** ‚úÖ Exists But Wasn't Documented
   - File exists at `src/components/ShareModal.js`
   - **Purpose:** Universal sharing modal for both campaigns and profiles
   - **Fix:** Added to CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md documentation

3. **Notification Pages Misdocumented**
   - `/profile/notifications` was called "preferences" but it's actually inbox
   - `/settings/notifications` wasn't fully documented
   - **Fix:** Updated both with accurate descriptions

## üöÄ Next Implementation Priorities

### Priority 1: Automated Notification Prompting (Highest ROI)
**Status:** Components ready, just needs integration

**Tasks:**
1. Decide prompting strategy:
   - Show modal after first campaign creation? ‚úÖ Recommended
   - Show banner on dashboard if permission not granted? ‚úÖ Recommended
   - Add to onboarding flow?

2. Implementation:
   - Add trigger in `/create/frame/page.js` and `/create/background/page.js`
   - Add banner to `/profile/page.js` (dashboard)
   - Track "don't ask again" preference
   - Respect user's previous dismissals

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours (just wiring up existing components)

---

### Priority 2: Appeals System
**Status:** Not started

**Requirements:**
1. **User Appeal Submission:**
   - `/appeal-ban/page.js` - Account ban appeal form
   - `/campaign/[slug]/appeal/page.js` - Campaign removal appeal form
   - Deadline countdown display
   - Submit to `/api/appeals/submit`

2. **Admin Appeals Management:**
   - `/admin/appeals/page.js` - List all pending appeals
   - Filter by type (Campaign / Account)
   - Approve/Reject actions with admin notes

3. **API Routes:**
   - POST `/api/appeals/submit`
   - GET `/api/admin/appeals`
   - PATCH `/api/admin/appeals/[appealId]`

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

---

### Priority 3: Admin Warning History View
**Status:** Deferred (low priority)

**Requirements:**
- Display warning count in `UserDetailsModal`
- Show warning history table
- Link to related reports

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

---

### Priority 4: Auto-Deletion Cron Jobs
**Status:** Deferred (infrastructure dependent)

**Requirements:**
- Choose cron service (Vercel Cron, Firebase Scheduled Functions)
- Daily job to check expired `appealDeadline`
- Permanent deletion logic

**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days (includes infrastructure setup)

---
