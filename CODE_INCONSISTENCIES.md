## 🔴 Important Issues

### 1. **Missing Information in Removal/Ban Notifications**

**What's the problem?**
When admins remove a campaign or ban a user, the notification sent to them is supposed to include:
- When the ban expires (appeal deadline)
- Why they were banned

But the system currently doesn't include this information in the notification.

**What does this mean?**
Users receive notifications saying "Your content was removed" but they don't know:
- How long they're banned for
- When they can appeal
- What specific reason led to the removal

**Impact:**
- Users feel confused and frustrated
- More support tickets from users asking "Why was I banned?" and "How long is my ban?"
- Less transparency in the moderation process

**Best solution:**
Update the code to pass the appeal deadline (30 days from now) and the reason to the notification. This gives users clear information about their situation.

### 2. **No Protection Against Report Spam**

**What's the problem?**
Anyone can submit unlimited reports. There's no limit on how many reports one person can send.

**What does this mean?**
- A malicious user could create 3 fake accounts and report a competitor's campaign to auto-hide it
- Someone could spam hundreds of reports to overload the system
- Bad actors can abuse the auto-hide feature (campaigns hide at 3 reports, users at 10)

**Impact:**
- Innocent campaigns can be hidden unfairly
- Competitors can abuse the system to sabotage each other
- System could be overwhelmed with fake reports
- Admins waste time reviewing spam reports

**Best solution:**
Add rate limiting:
- Maximum 5 reports per hour per user
- Users can't report the same campaign/user multiple times
- Track suspicious patterns (same user reporting many different campaigns)

---

### 3. **Users Use Two Different Status Fields**

**What's the problem?**
The system tracks user status in two different ways:
- `moderationStatus` (for temporary hiding due to reports)
- `accountStatus` (for bans and account state)

Sometimes both are updated, sometimes only one is updated. It's inconsistent.

**What does this mean?**
For campaigns, there's only one status field to check. For users, you need to check both fields to know their real status. This makes the code confusing.

**Impact:**
- Developers can make mistakes by forgetting to update both fields
- Harder to understand user state (is someone banned? hidden? both?)
- Potential bugs where one field is updated but the other isn't

**Best solution:**
Choose one approach and stick with it:
- **Option 1:** Use only `moderationStatus` for everything
- **Option 2:** Use `accountStatus` for permanent bans, `moderationStatus` for temporary auto-hides
- **Option 3:** Document clearly when each field should be used

Recommendation: Go with Option 2 - it's clearest and separates temporary vs permanent actions.

### 4. **No Validation for Content Type**

**What's the problem?**
The code assumes reports are either for "campaign" or "user" but doesn't validate this. If somehow an invalid type gets through, the code will break.

**What does this mean?**
The code uses if/else logic:
- If it's a campaign, do X
- Otherwise (assumes it's a user), do Y

But "otherwise" could be anything - a typo, corrupted data, or a bug.

**Impact:**
- If invalid data gets in, the system could update the wrong things
- Hard to debug because there's no error message
- Silent failures that admins won't notice

**Best solution:**
Add validation:
- Check that type is either "campaign" or "user"
- If it's anything else, show a clear error message
- Prevents silent failures and makes bugs easier to find

## 💡 Nice-to-Have Improvements

### 5. **Warning Notifications Don't Explain Why**

**What's the problem?**
When a user gets a warning, the notification just says "You've received a warning" without explaining what they did wrong.

**What does this mean?**
Users don't know what to fix or avoid in the future.

**Impact:**
- Users might repeat the same behavior
- More support questions asking "What did I do wrong?"
- Less educational value from warnings

**Best solution:**
Include the most common reason from reports in the warning notification. For example: "You've received a warning for: Inappropriate content (5 reports)"

---

### 6. **Old Information in Reports Table**

**What's the problem?**
When someone reports a campaign, the system saves the campaign title and image at that moment. If the creator later changes the title or image, the admin still sees the old version in the reports table.

**What does this mean?**
An admin might see a report for a campaign titled "Offensive Name" but when they check the actual campaign, it's been renamed to "Birthday Party."

**Impact:**
- Admins might get confused seeing outdated information
- They need to click through to see the current state
- Reports for already-fixed issues waste admin time

**Best solution:**
Three options:
- **Option 1:** Always show live data (slower but always accurate)
- **Option 2:** Auto-update cached data when campaigns change (requires extra code)
- **Option 3:** Accept that table data might be slightly old (current approach)

Currently using Option 1 for the main reports table, which is good.

### 7. **Can't Track Which Admin Did What**

**What's the problem?**
When an admin takes action (ban, warning, dismiss), the system tries to save who did it, but falls back to the generic word "admin" if the user ID isn't available.

**What does this mean?**
If multiple admins work on reports, you can't tell who made which decision.

**Impact:**
- No accountability for admin actions
- Can't track admin performance
- If there's a mistake, can't identify who made it

**Best solution:**
- Require admin login before taking actions
- Always save the specific admin's ID and name
- Create an admin activity log page

---

### 8. **No Reminder for Appeal Deadlines**

**What's the problem?**
When a campaign is removed or user is banned, they have 30 days to appeal. But the system doesn't remind them as the deadline approaches.

**What does this mean?**
Users might forget to appeal until it's too late.

**Impact:**
- Users miss their appeal window
- More angry users claiming the system is unfair
- Support has to deal with "I missed the deadline" requests

**Best solution:**
Send automatic reminders:
- 3 days before deadline: "Reminder: You have 3 days left to appeal"
- 1 day before deadline: "Final reminder: Appeal deadline is tomorrow"

---

### 9. **Deleted Campaigns Still Show in Reports**

**What's the problem?**
If a campaign gets reported and auto-hidden, then the creator just deletes it entirely, the report still shows up in the admin queue.

**What does this mean?**
Admins waste time reviewing reports for content that no longer exists.

**Impact:**
- Admin time wasted on non-existent content
- Reports queue gets cluttered
- Can't take action on deleted content anyway

**Best solution:**
When a campaign is deleted, automatically dismiss all related pending reports with a note "Target was deleted by creator."

---

### 10. **No Way to Undo Accidental Admin Actions**

**What's the problem?**
If an admin accidentally clicks "Ban User" instead of "Warn User," there's no undo button. They have to manually find the user and reverse the action.

**What does this mean?**
Accidental clicks lead to long cleanup processes.

**Impact:**
- Wastes admin time
- Users experience temporary unfair bans
- Higher chance of admin errors causing problems

**Best solution:**
Three options:
- **Option 1:** Add "Undo" button that appears for 10 seconds after action
- **Option 2:** Require typing "CONFIRM" before bans/removals
- **Option 3:** Create admin history page where recent actions can be reversed

Recommendation: Combine Options 2 and 3 for maximum safety.

---

### 11. **Performance: Too Many Database Reads**

**What's the problem?**
When loading the reports table, the system fetches the current campaign/user data for every single report to show the latest information.

**What does this mean?**
If there are 100 reports, that's 100 extra database reads every time an admin views the page.

**Impact:**
- Slower page load times for admins
- Higher database costs
- Could slow down if there are thousands of reports

**Best solution:**
Three options:
- **Option 1:** Only fetch live data when admin clicks on a specific report
- **Option 2:** Use cached data for table, accept it might be slightly old
- **Option 3:** Set up automatic background updates to keep cached data fresh

Recommendation: Option 1 for balance of speed and accuracy.

## ✅ Recently Fixed Issues (October 18, 2025)

The following critical issues have been fixed and are working correctly:

1. ✅ **Notifications for restored campaigns** - Now correctly sent when admins dismiss reports
2. ✅ **User account restoration** - Banned users are now fully restored when reports are dismissed
3. ✅ **Warning behavior** - Content is now visible again after warnings (warnings are "slap on the wrist," not removal)
