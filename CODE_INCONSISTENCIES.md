**Last Updated:** October 19, 2025

This document tracks known issues and suggested improvements for the Twibbonize reporting system.

### 2. **No Way to Undo Accidental Admin Actions**

**What's the problem?**
If an admin accidentally clicks "Ban User" instead of "Warn User," there's no undo button. They have to manually find the user and reverse the action.

**What does this mean?**
Accidental clicks lead to long cleanup processes.

**Impact:**
- Wastes admin time
- Users experience temporary unfair bans
- Higher chance of admin errors causing problems

**Best solution:**
Three options:
- **Option 1:** Add "Undo" button that appears for 10 seconds after action
- **Option 2:** Require typing "CONFIRM" before bans/removals
- **Option 3:** Create admin history page where recent actions can be reversed

Recommendation: Combine Options 2 and 3 for maximum safety.

### 3. **Performance: Too Many Database Reads**

**What's the problem?**
When loading the reports table, the system fetches the current campaign/user data for every single report to show the latest information.

**What does this mean?**
If there are 100 reports, that's 100 extra database reads every time an admin views the page.

**Impact:**
- Slower page load times for admins
- Higher database costs
- Could slow down if there are thousands of reports

**Best solution:**
Three options:
- **Option 1:** Only fetch live data when admin clicks on a specific report
- **Option 2:** Use cached data for table, accept it might be slightly old
- **Option 3:** Set up automatic background updates to keep cached data fresh

Recommendation: Option 1 for balance of speed and accuracy.

### 4. **Can't Track Which Admin Did What**

**What's the problem?**
When an admin takes action (ban, warning, dismiss), the system tries to save who did it, but falls back to the generic word "admin" if the user ID isn't available.

**What does this mean?**
If multiple admins work on reports, you can't tell who made which decision.

**Impact:**
- No accountability for admin actions
- Can't track admin performance
- If there's a mistake, can't identify who made it

**Best solution:**
- Require admin login before taking actions
- Always save the specific admin's ID and name
- Create an admin activity log page

---

### 5. **No Reminder for Appeal Deadlines**

**What's the problem?**
When a campaign is removed or user is banned, they have 30 days to appeal. But the system doesn't remind them as the deadline approaches.

**What does this mean?**
Users might forget to appeal until it's too late.

**Impact:**
- Users miss their appeal window
- More angry users claiming the system is unfair
- Support has to deal with "I missed the deadline" requests

**Best solution:**
Send automatic reminders:
- 3 days before deadline: "Reminder: You have 3 days left to appeal"
- 1 day before deadline: "Final reminder: Appeal deadline is tomorrow"

## üìù Notes

**Last reviewed:** October 19, 2025


**Testing recommendations:**
- Test IP-based rate limiting by submitting multiple reports from same IP
- Test duplicate report prevention
- Test admin reason selection modal appears when clicking "Warn" or "Ban/Remove"
- Test that "Continue" button is disabled until a reason is selected
- Test notification content includes the admin-selected reason and appeal deadline
- Test that warning and ban actions fail if reason is not provided
- Test campaign deletion: Delete button only visible on own profile
- Test campaign deletion: Confirmation modal appears before deletion
- Test campaign deletion: Related reports are auto-dismissed
- Test campaign deletion: User's campaign count decreases
- Test admin dashboard: Deleted campaign reports don't appear in pending queue
- Review admin logs to confirm action tracking works

**Future considerations:**
- Add automated tests for all admin actions
- Create admin troubleshooting guide
- Consider adding API documentation for developers
