âš  Production Issues to Address:
HIGH PRIORITY
1. Loading State & Multi-Submit Prevention
// Current Issue: No loading protection during skip/complete actions
const handleSkip = async () => {
  // Missing loading state could allow multiple submits
}
// Fix Needed: Add loading states
const [skipLoading, setSkipLoading] = useState(false);
2. Error Recovery & User Feedback
Issue: Silent failures during skip could cause redirect loops
Fix: Surface errors to user with retry options
Impact: Users could get stuck if Firestore operations fail
3. Already-Complete User Handling
Issue: Users who've completed onboarding can still access /onboarding
Fix: Redirect complete users to dashboard/profile page
Impact: Confusing user experience for returning users
MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. Enhanced Validation & Security
File Upload Validation: Add file size limits, type checking, malware scanning
Rate Limiting: Prevent username checking abuse
XSS Protection: Sanitize user inputs (bio, display name)
5. Performance Optimizations
Image Optimization: Compress uploaded images before storage
Lazy Loading: Load country list and heavy components on demand
Caching: Cache username availability checks
6. Accessibility Enhancements
Screen Reader: Add proper ARIA labels and descriptions
Color Contrast: Ensure all text meets WCAG AA standards
Keyboard Navigation: Improve tab order and focus management
LOW PRIORITY
7. Advanced Features
Auto-Save: Save draft profile data during editing
Progress Indicator: Show completion percentage
Social Integration: Import profile data from social accounts
Profile Templates: Pre-filled profile suggestions
8. Analytics & Monitoring
Completion Metrics: Track onboarding completion rates
Error Tracking: Monitor validation failures and API errors
Performance Monitoring: Track page load times and user interactions
