Perfect! I've completed my comprehensive analysis. Here's the detailed breakdown of Issue #2 (Storage Bucket Structure):

📊 COMPLETE ANALYSIS - Issue #2: Storage Bucket Structure
CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
Supabase Setup:
Single bucket name: uploads
All file operations (upload-url, signed-url, delete, list) hardcoded to use .from('uploads') bucket
Folder structure inside the bucket:
uploads/
├── uploads/{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
├── profile-images/{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
├── documents/{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
└── temp/{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
How Profile & Banner Images Currently Work:
Profile & Banner images ARE stored in the uploads bucket
They use folder paths like: profile-images/{userId}/{timestamp}-image.png
HOWEVER, the profile edit page has a BUG: It's NOT actually uploading to Supabase!
Line 414-425 in profile/edit/page.js saves images as base64 data URLs directly to Firestore
This is inefficient and not using the proper storage system
Comment in code says: // Handle profile image (in a real app, you'd upload to storage service)
WHAT DOCUMENTATION EXPECTS:
According to CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM.md:

New dedicated bucket: campaigns
Path structure: campaigns/{userId}/{campaignId}.png
Example: campaigns/user123abc/campaign456def.png
Benefits:
Clear ownership
Easy batch deletion per user
Separation from profile/other uploads
DETAILED PLAN - What You Need To Do:
✅ OPTION 1: Keep Current Bucket (RECOMMENDED)
Why this is better:

Profile & banner images already use the uploads bucket
No need to create a new bucket
Just add a new folder structure inside existing bucket
Manual Steps in Supabase:

Do NOT delete the uploads bucket - you need it!
Do NOT create a campaigns bucket
✅ That's it! No manual Supabase changes needed
Code Changes Needed:

Add campaigns to the allowed folders list (4 files)
Update path structure for campaign uploads: campaigns/{userId}/{campaignId}.png instead of uploads/{userId}/{timestamp}-{filename}
Keep everything else the same
New structure will be:

uploads/  (bucket - already exists)
├── uploads/{userId}/{timestamp}-file.ext          ← Generic uploads
├── profile-images/{userId}/{timestamp}-image.ext  ← Profile/banner (existing)
├── documents/{userId}/{timestamp}-doc.ext         ← Documents (existing)
├── temp/{userId}/{timestamp}-temp.ext             ← Temp files (existing)
└── campaigns/{userId}/{campaignId}.png            ← NEW: Campaign images
❌ OPTION 2: Create Separate Campaigns Bucket (Not Recommended)
Why this is NOT ideal:

Adds complexity - you'll have TWO buckets to manage
Profile images stay in uploads bucket anyway
More configuration needed
Manual Steps in Supabase:

Create new bucket named campaigns
Configure bucket permissions (public read access)
Keep the uploads bucket for profiles
Code Changes Needed:

All 4 storage API files need logic to choose bucket based on file type
More complex - need to handle two different buckets
FILES THAT NEED CODE CHANGES (If Option 1):
src/app/api/storage/upload-url/route.js (Line 32, 48)

Add 'campaigns' to allowedFolders array
Keep .from('uploads') unchanged
src/app/api/storage/signed-url/route.js (Line 36-41, 50)

Add campaigns/${decodedToken.uid}/ to allowedPrefixes
Keep .from('uploads') unchanged
src/app/api/storage/delete/route.js (Line 36-41, 50)

Add campaigns/${decodedToken.uid}/ to allowedPrefixes
Keep .from('uploads') unchanged
src/app/api/storage/list/route.js (Line 35, 44)

Add 'campaigns' to allowedFolders array
Keep .from('uploads') unchanged
NEW: Create campaign upload logic

Path format: campaigns/{userId}/{campaignId}.png (no timestamp prefix)
This is different from profile images which use timestamps
ADDITIONAL BUG TO FIX:
Profile Edit Page Bug (src/app/(chrome)/profile/edit/page.js):

Currently saves images as base64 to Firestore (lines 414-425)
Should use uploadFile(file, 'profile-images') from src/lib/supabase.js
Fix this to properly use Supabase storage
🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION:
Use Option 1 - Keep the single uploads bucket and add campaigns as a new folder inside it.

Why?

✅ No manual Supabase changes needed
✅ Simpler code changes
✅ Profile/banner images already work this way
✅ All files in one place
✅ Consistent with current architecture
Should I proceed with Option 1? I'll:

Update the 4 storage API files to allow the campaigns folder
Document the final structure
Mark Issue #2 as FIXED
Let me know if you prefer Option 2 instead, or if you have questions!
