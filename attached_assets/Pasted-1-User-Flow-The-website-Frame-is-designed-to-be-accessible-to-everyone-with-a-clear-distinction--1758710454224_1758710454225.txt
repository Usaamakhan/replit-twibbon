1. User Flow
The website, Frame, is designed to be accessible to everyone, with a clear distinction between two user types: visitors and creators. The entire user experience is built around simplicity for visitors while providing robust tools for creators.

Visitors (Non-logged-in Users)
Discovery: A visitor lands on the homepage and is immediately presented with a public gallery of trending frames, which can be filtered by time (e.g., today's top) or country. They can also use a search bar to find a specific frame.

Frame Selection: After finding a frame they like, the visitor clicks on it to view its details.

Usage: On the frame's dedicated page, the user can upload their own photo. The website will automatically overlay the frame onto the photo.

Download: The user can download the final framed photo without needing to create an account. The process is quick and seamless.

Creators (Logged-in Users)
Account Creation: To upload their own frames, a user must create an account. This is the only action on the site that requires an account.

Frame Upload: Once logged in, a creator can access a dedicated upload page. They can upload their frame design, give it a name and description, and add relevant tags.

Frame Management: Creators can view and manage all the frames they have uploaded from their personal dashboard. They can see how their frames are performing and can edit or delete them as needed.

2. Core Features
Public Gallery: This is the heart of the website. It displays all publicly available frames. All content, including a frame's usage statistics, is public and can be accessed by anyone. The gallery is the primary way visitors interact with the site's content.

Frame Analytics: Public analytics are a key feature of the website. Anyone can view how a frame is performing, including its number of uses, downloads, and popularity over time and in different countries. These public metrics create a transparent and engaging environment.

Trending & Top Creators: This feature highlights the most popular frames and the creators with the most successful uploads. Rankings are based on usage data, encouraging a healthy community and providing motivation for creators to upload high-quality content.

User Account (for Creators only): A streamlined system for creators to manage their profile and uploaded content. It is designed to be simple, focusing on the essential tools needed for content creation and management.
