Perfect! I've completed my analysis. Here's what I found and my implementation plan:

üìä Current Architecture Analysis
‚úÖ What Exists:
/profile/notifications - Settings page (toggle on/off, manage devices)
Mobile menu - Already has link to notifications
Notification templates - Well-defined in notificationTemplates.js
Send API - /api/notifications/send sends FCM to devices
Database pattern - users/{userId}/tokens/{tokenId} for devices
‚ùå What's Missing:
No notification history storage in database
No history page to view past notifications
No API to fetch notification history
No bell icon with unread count
üéØ Implementation Plan
Based on your codebase patterns, here's my approach:

1. Database Structure (Following existing patterns)
users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}
  - type: 'warning' | 'campaign-removed' | 'campaign-restored' | 'account-banned' | etc.
  - title: "‚ö† Warning Issued"
  - body: "You've received a warning..."
  - actionUrl: "/profile/settings"
  - icon: "/icon-192x192.png"
  - read: false
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - metadata: { campaignId, reportId, reason, etc. }
2. New Files to Create:
Page: /profile/notifications/inbox

List all notifications (like campaigns page pattern)
Filter: All, Unread, Warnings, Removals, Restorations
Empty state with helpful message
Click to mark as read and navigate to action
Delete individual notifications
API Route: /api/notifications/history

GET: Fetch user's notifications with filters
PATCH: Mark as read/unread
DELETE: Delete notification
Component: NotificationBell (Header icon)

Shows unread count badge
Click opens dropdown or navigates to inbox
Real-time updates via Firestore listener
3. Update Existing:
/api/notifications/send/route.js

After sending FCM, also save to Firestore history
Store notification details for later viewing
MobileMenu.js

Change /profile/notifications link to say "Notification Settings"
Add new link /profile/notifications/inbox for "Inbox" or "History"
OR simpler: Keep /profile/notifications as history, move settings to /profile/notifications/settings

ü§î Design Decisions for Your Approval:
Question 1: Page Structure

Option A: /profile/notifications = History (move settings to /settings)
Option B: /profile/notifications/inbox = History (keep settings as is)
My recommendation: Option B (less breaking changes)
Question 2: Bell Icon Location

Option A: Add to Header (next to hamburger menu)
Option B: Only in mobile menu with badge
My recommendation: Option A for better visibility
Question 3: Auto-delete old notifications

Should I auto-delete notifications older than 30/60/90 days?
My recommendation: Keep 60 days, add cleanup cron job
Question 4: Real-time updates

Use Firestore listener for real-time unread count?
My recommendation: Yes, use onSnapshot in useFCM hook
Would you like me to proceed with this plan? Or do you want to adjust any design decisions first?
