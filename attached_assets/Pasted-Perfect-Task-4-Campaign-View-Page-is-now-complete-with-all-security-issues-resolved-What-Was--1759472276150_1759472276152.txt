Perfect! ‚úÖ Task #4: Campaign View Page is now complete with all security issues resolved!

What Was Completed
üõ° Critical Security Fix
I identified and fixed a serious vulnerability where anonymous users could fake their identity and manipulate creator supporter counts. Here's what I implemented:

Server-Side Download Tracking API (/api/campaigns/track-download):

Uses Firebase Admin SDK to securely track downloads
Verifies user identity with Firebase ID tokens (not client-provided data)
Anonymous users: Can download freely, increments campaign counter only
Authenticated users: Token verified, increments both campaign AND creator counters
Invalid/spoofed tokens: Treated as anonymous (safe fallback)
How It Works:

User clicks download (authenticated or anonymous)
If authenticated, app gets a fresh ID token from Firebase
Token sent in Authorization header to server
Server verifies token authenticity before trusting user identity
Counters increment atomically (campaign always, creator only for verified non-creators)
‚úÖ Campaign View Page Features
Visitor photo upload with 10MB limit (PNG/JPG/WEBP)
Real-time Canvas preview with live image composition
Adjustment controls: Zoom (0.5-3x), drag positioning, Fit button, Reset button
Download button (disabled until photo uploaded)
Share buttons: Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, native share API
Report modal for flagging inappropriate campaigns
üìù Files Updated
src/app/(chrome)/campaign/[slug]/page.js - Complete visitor experience
src/app/api/campaigns/track-download/route.js - Secure tracking API
src/lib/firebaseAdmin.js - Added Firestore support for server operations
TASKS.md - Marked Task #4 as completed with full documentation
replit.md - Updated project status
üîê Security Benefits
‚úÖ No more identity spoofing (tokens verified server-side)
‚úÖ Anonymous downloads work correctly (campaign counter increments)
‚úÖ Authenticated downloads properly credit creators
‚úÖ Admin SDK bypasses client security rules (allows anonymous access)
‚úÖ Atomic transactions prevent race conditions
Testing Recommendations for Vercel
Since you test on Vercel (where Firebase/Supabase credentials are configured), here's what to verify:

Anonymous Flow:

Visit a campaign page without signing in
Upload your photo and download
Verify campaign supportersCount increments (check database)
Authenticated Flow:

Sign in as a different user (not campaign creator)
Upload photo and download
Verify both campaign AND creator supportersCount increment
Creator Flow:

Sign in as the campaign creator
Download your own campaign
Verify only campaign supportersCount increments (not your own creator count)
Next Steps
You've now completed 3 out of 5 Phase 1 priorities:

‚úÖ Priority 1: Create Entry Point (modal)
‚úÖ Priority 2: Upload Flows (frame & background)
‚úÖ Priority 3: Campaign View Page (with secure download tracking)
‚è≥ Priority 4: Discovery Pages (/campaigns gallery + /creators leaderboard)
‚è≥ Priority 5: Testing & Validation
Would you like me to build the discovery pages next (campaigns gallery and creators leaderboard)?
