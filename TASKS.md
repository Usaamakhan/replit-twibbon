## üéØ Pre-Build Tasks

### 1. Add Missing Supabase Validations
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

**Description:**
Before users upload campaigns, add security validations to prevent abuse and errors.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add file size limits (5MB max for campaigns, 10MB for others)
- [x] Add server-side file type validation (PNG, JPG, WEBP for campaigns)
- [x] Added robust validation using Number.isFinite() and positive number checks
- [x] Added empty string validation for fileType

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/api/storage/upload-url/route.js` - Added required validations
- `src/app/api/storage/campaign-upload-url/route.js` - Added required validations

**Completed:** October 02, 2025

## üêõ Bug Fixes (Pre-Phase 1)

### 1.1. Fix ProfilePage Campaign Display Bugs
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

**Description:**
ProfilePage.js has incorrect field mappings when displaying user campaigns.

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Line 90**: Changed `campaign.frameImageUrl` to `campaign.imageUrl`
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: Now uses correct schema field for thumbnails
   - Campaign images will display correctly when campaigns exist

2. **Line 91**: Changed `campaign.usageCount` to `campaign.supportersCount`
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: Now displays correct supporter count (downloads)
   - Note: `usageCount` = total interactions, `supportersCount` = total downloads (different metrics)

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/components/ProfilePage.js` (lines 90-91)

**Completed:** October 02, 2025

### 1.2. Firebase Initialization Race Condition
**Status:** ‚è≥ Pending

**Description:**
Firebase is only initialized inside `useFirebaseOptimized()` hook, but `src/lib/firestore.js` exports db and auth as module-level variables that are null until a component mounts.

**Impact:**
- Cold starts may fail with "Database not available" errors
- Functions like `createUserProfile()`, `getUserProfile()` return early with errors
- Race condition: If `useAuth()` runs before `useFirebaseOptimized()`, Firebase throws "No Firebase App '[DEFAULT]' has been created"
- Server-side code (API routes, build-time utilities) can never access Firebase client SDK

**Files Affected:**
- `src/lib/firebase-optimized.js` (lines 9-12, 122) - exports null variables
- `src/lib/firestore.js` (line 4) - imports potentially null db
- All components using Firebase before proper initialization

**Priority:** High (architectural issue affecting reliability)

**Note:** This is an architectural design choice. The current pattern works for client-side only usage. Consider refactoring if server-side Firebase access is needed.

- [ ] Upload frame without transparency (should fail)
- [ ] Upload background (no transparency check)
- [ ] Create campaign while logged out ‚Üí auth popup
- [ ] Download campaign image
- [ ] Verify supportersCount increments
- [ ] Test filters on campaigns gallery
- [ ] Test leaderboard sorting
