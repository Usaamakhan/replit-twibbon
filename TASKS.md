## 🎯 3-PAGE CAMPAIGN FLOW IMPLEMENTATION

### Status: ✅ Completed (Ready for Vercel Testing)
**Start Date:** October 03, 2025
**Completion Date:** October 04, 2025

---

## Overview: 3-Page Visitor Flow

Implementing a multi-page visitor experience for campaigns to increase ad impressions and improve engagement. This matches competitor (Twibbonize) best practices.

**Current State:** Single-page campaign experience
**Target State:** 3-page funnel with state persistence

---

## Architecture Summary

### Page Structure
1. **Page 1** `/campaign/[slug]` - Upload page
   - Campaign display with preview
   - "Choose Your Photo" CTA
   - Gallery of supporter posts
   
2. **Page 2** `/campaign/[slug]/adjust` - Adjustment page
   - Photo composition canvas
   - Adjustment controls (zoom, position)
   - Download button
   
3. **Page 3** `/campaign/[slug]/result` - Result page
   - Final image display
   - Share buttons
   - "Start Over" button

### State Management
- **Context**: React Context (`CampaignSessionContext`)
- **Persistence**: sessionStorage for page reload resilience
- **Lifecycle**: Auto-clear on "Start Over" or 24h expiry

### Navigation Flow
```
Upload Photo → Auto-redirect to /adjust
Download → Auto-redirect to /result
Start Over → Clear session → Redirect to base page
```

## Previous Campaign System Work

*(All previous tasks moved below for reference)*

---

## 🎯 Pre-Build Tasks

### 1. Add Missing Supabase Validations
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Before users upload campaigns, add security validations to prevent abuse and errors.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add file size limits (5MB max for campaigns, 10MB for others)
- [x] Add server-side file type validation (PNG, JPG, WEBP for campaigns)
- [x] Added robust validation using Number.isFinite() and positive number checks
- [x] Added empty string validation for fileType

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/api/storage/upload-url/route.js` - Added required validations
- `src/app/api/storage/campaign-upload-url/route.js` - Added required validations

**Completed:** October 02, 2025

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes (Pre-Phase 1)

### 1.1. Fix ProfilePage Campaign Display Bugs
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
ProfilePage.js has incorrect field mappings when displaying user campaigns.

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Line 90**: Changed `campaign.frameImageUrl` to `campaign.imageUrl`
   - ✅ Fixed: Now uses correct schema field for thumbnails
   - Campaign images will display correctly when campaigns exist

2. **Line 91**: Changed `campaign.usageCount` to `campaign.supportersCount`
   - ✅ Fixed: Now displays correct supporter count (downloads)
   - Note: We don't track `usageCount` (views/analytics) - only `supportersCount` (total downloads)

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/components/ProfilePage.js` (lines 90-91)

**Completed:** October 02, 2025

---

### 1.2. Firebase Initialization Race Condition
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Firebase is only initialized inside `useFirebaseOptimized()` hook, but `src/lib/firestore.js` exports db and auth as module-level variables that are null until a component mounts.

**Solution Implemented:**
Refactored Firebase initialization to happen at module load time instead of inside React hook:

1. **Module-level initialization**: Firebase now initializes immediately when the module loads (client-side only)
2. **No race conditions**: `db` and `auth` exports are set before any components mount
3. **Simplified hook**: `useFirebaseOptimized()` now just returns already-initialized instances
4. **Cold start protection**: Initialization happens synchronously at module load, preventing "Database not available" errors

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Moved Firebase initialization from `useEffect` to module-level function `initializeFirebaseModule()`
- ✅ Added immediate initialization call at module load: `initializeFirebaseModule()`
- ✅ Updated `useFirebaseOptimized()` to return already-initialized instances
- ✅ Exports (`auth`, `db`) now available immediately, not null until hook runs

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/lib/firebase-optimized.js` - Complete refactor to module-level initialization

**Completed:** October 02, 2025

---

### 3.5. Priority 2.5: Missing Prerequisites for Campaign View Page
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Before building the campaign view page (Task #4), we need to create missing backend functions and utilities for fetching campaigns and composing images.

**Missing Items Identified (October 02, 2025):**

#### A. Firestore Function: getCampaignBySlug()
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Why Needed:**
Campaign view page needs to fetch campaign data by slug from URL parameter `/campaign/[slug]`

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add `getCampaignBySlug(slug)` function to `src/lib/firestore.js`
- [x] Query campaigns collection where `slug === slug`
- [x] Return campaign document with creator info
- [x] Handle 404 case (campaign not found)
- [x] Respect `moderationStatus` (don't show removed campaigns)

**Expected Function Signature:**
```javascript
async function getCampaignBySlug(slug) {
  // Query campaigns collection by slug field
  // Return { campaign, creator } or null if not found
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Firestore `where('slug', '==', slug)` query
- Join with creator's user profile data
- Check `moderationStatus !== 'removed'`
- Cache results if needed (optional optimization)

---

#### B. Canvas Composition Utility: imageComposition.js
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Why Needed:**
Campaign view page needs to overlay/underlay user photos with campaign images

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `src/utils/imageComposition.js` utility file
- [x] Implement `composeImages(userPhoto, campaignImage, adjustments, type)` function
- [x] Handle Frame type: User photo UNDER frame (frame on top)
- [x] Handle Background type: User photo ON TOP of background
- [x] Apply adjustments: scale (zoom), x position, y position
- [x] Export composed image as downloadable PNG/JPG
- [x] Add image quality/format options

**Expected Functions:**
```javascript
// Main composition function
async function composeImages(userPhotoFile, campaignImageUrl, adjustments, campaignType) {
  // adjustments = { scale: 1.0, x: 0, y: 0 }
  // campaignType = 'frame' | 'background'
  // Returns: Canvas element or Blob for download
}

// Helper: Load image from URL/File
function loadImage(source) { }

// Helper: Apply transformations
function applyAdjustments(canvas, ctx, img, adjustments) { }

// Helper: Export canvas to downloadable format
function exportCanvas(canvas, format = 'png') { }
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use native Canvas API (no external libraries needed)
- Frame composition: Draw user photo first, then frame on top
- Background composition: Draw background first, then user photo on top
- Handle aspect ratios correctly (letterbox/pillarbox if needed)
- Provide high-quality export (avoid compression artifacts)
- Clean up resources (revokeObjectURL) to prevent memory leaks

**Algorithm (Frame Type):**
1. Create canvas matching campaign image dimensions
2. Draw user photo (scaled/positioned per adjustments)
3. Draw frame image on top (covers user photo where not transparent)
4. Export as PNG to preserve transparency

**Algorithm (Background Type):**
1. Create canvas matching campaign image dimensions
2. Draw background image first (full canvas)
3. Draw user photo on top (scaled/positioned per adjustments)
4. Export as PNG or JPG

---

**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH - Blocking Task #4

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes total
- getCampaignBySlug: 15-20 minutes
