## üö® Section 9: Report System - Critical Fixes & Enhancements

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING - Action Buttons Currently Non-Functional  
**Last Updated:** October 08, 2025

### Problem Discovered

The admin report action buttons (**Dismiss Report**, **Warn Creator**, **Remove Campaign**) currently **only update the report status** but **do NOT perform the actual actions** they claim to do. This is a critical gap in functionality.

---

### 9.1: Fix Report Action Buttons (CRITICAL)

**Updated Moderation Workflow (October 2025):**

#### Auto-Moderation Rules:
- **Campaigns:** Hide from public at 3+ reports (status: `under-review-hidden`)
- **Profiles:** Hide from public at 10+ reports (status: `under-review-hidden`)
- Warning does NOT auto-ban/remove, only sends notifications and tracks history

---

#### 1. **Dismiss Report** Button
- ‚úÖ **Current:** Updates report to `status: dismissed`, `action: no-action`
- **New Behavior:**
  - Reset campaign/profile `reportsCount` to 0
  - Change status back to `active` (unhide if hidden)
  - Mark all related reports as `dismissed`
  - No notification sent

**Tasks to Fix:**
- [ ] Update dismiss action to reset reportsCount to 0
- [ ] Change campaign/profile status back to `active`
- [ ] Unhide from public if it was hidden

---

#### 2. **Warn Creator** Button
- ‚úÖ **Current:** Updates report to `status: resolved`, `action: warned`
- **New Behavior (No Auto-Ban):**
  - Create warning record in Firestore (for admin tracking only)
  - Send in-app notification to creator about warning
  - Track warning history visible to admins
  - Does NOT auto-ban or remove content
  - Admin manually decides ban/removal based on warning count

**Tasks to Fix:**
- [ ] Create `warnings` collection in Firestore:
  ```javascript
  {
    userId: string,
    targetType: 'campaign' | 'profile',
    targetId: string,  // campaignId or userId
    reportId: string,
    reason: string,
    issuedBy: adminId,
    issuedAt: timestamp,
    acknowledged: boolean,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update API route `/api/admin/reports/[reportId]/route.js`:
  - Create warning document in Firestore
  - Send in-app notification to creator (NOT email)
  - Display warning count on admin user details panel
- [ ] Create admin view to see user's warning history
- [ ] NO auto-escalation logic (admin manually decides)

---

#### 3. **Remove Campaign** Button
- ‚úÖ **Current:** Updates report to `status: resolved`, `action: removed`
- **New Behavior (Temporary Removal with 30-Day Appeal):**
  - Mark campaign as `removed-temporary` (soft delete)
  - Campaign hidden from public but NOT deleted
  - Send in-app notification with appeal option
  - 30-day appeal window before permanent deletion
  - If resubmitted and removed again ‚Üí permanent deletion

**Tasks to Fix:**
- [ ] Update API route `/api/admin/reports/[reportId]/route.js`:
  - Set campaign `moderationStatus` to `removed-temporary`
  - Set `removedAt` timestamp
  - Set `removalReason` field
  - Set `appealDeadline` (30 days from removal)
  - Keep image in Supabase (don't delete yet)
  - Send in-app notification with appeal link
- [ ] Create appeal submission system:
  - Creator can appeal within 30 days
  - Appeal creates entry in `appeals` collection
  - Admin reviews appeals in `/admin/appeals`
- [ ] After 30 days without appeal ‚Üí auto-delete permanently
- [ ] On second removal (after appeal approved) ‚Üí permanent deletion
- [ ] Update campaign queries to filter `removed-temporary` status

---

### 9.2: Notification & Messaging System

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è NOT IMPLEMENTED - No notification system exists

**Current State:**
- ‚ùå No push notifications
- ‚ùå No email notifications
- ‚ùå No notification preferences
- ‚ùå Users are unaware when:
  - Their campaign is reported
  - Their campaign is removed
  - They receive a warning
  - They are banned

**Decision: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Push Notifications**

#### A. FCM Push Notification System
- [ ] Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging in Firebase Console
- [ ] Configure FCM for web push notifications (VAPID keys)
- [ ] Store FCM device tokens in Firestore:
  ```javascript
  // Collection: users/{userId}/tokens/{tokenId}
  {
    token: string,              // FCM device token
    device: 'web' | 'android' | 'ios',
    createdAt: timestamp,
    lastUsed: timestamp,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Create `/api/notifications/register-token/route.js`:
  - POST: Save user's FCM device token
  - Support multiple devices per user
- [ ] Create `/api/notifications/send/route.js` (server-side):
  - Use Firebase Admin SDK to send FCM messages
  - Support notification payload with data payload
  - Handle multi-device delivery
- [ ] Implement FCM token management:
  - Request permission on login
  - Save token to Firestore
  - Refresh token on expiry
  - Delete token on logout
- [ ] Create notification service worker for web push:
  - Handle background notifications
  - Deep link to action URLs
  - Show notification UI

#### B. Notification UI Components
- [ ] Create `useFCM()` hook for token management
- [ ] Add notification permission request modal
- [ ] Create notification preferences page (`/profile/settings`)
- [ ] Allow users to enable/disable push notifications

#### C. Email Notification System (Future - Phase 3)
- [ ] Email as secondary notification channel (optional)
- [ ] Resend.com integration for critical notifications only
- [ ] Templates: Account banned, Appeal deadline reminder (3 days before)
- [ ] User can opt-out of emails (keep push notifications only)

#### D. Notification Triggers (FCM Push)
- [ ] Campaign gets 3 reports ‚Üí Auto-hide + Notify creator "Campaign Under Review"
- [ ] Campaign removed temporarily ‚Üí Notify with appeal link (30-day deadline)
- [ ] Warning issued ‚Üí Notify creator (track in warning history)
- [ ] Profile gets 10 reports ‚Üí Auto-hide + Notify user "Profile Under Review"
- [ ] Account banned ‚Üí Notify with appeal link (30-day deadline)
- [ ] Appeal deadline reminder ‚Üí 3 days before expiry
- [ ] Admin dismisses reports ‚Üí Notify creator "Campaign/Profile Restored"

    reportedBy: string | 'anonymous',
    reason: 'inappropriate_avatar' | 'offensive_username' | 'spam_bio' | 'impersonation' | 'other',
    details: string,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update `reports` collection schema:
  ```javascript
  {
    type: 'campaign' | 'profile',  // NEW FIELD
    campaignId?: string,  // For campaign reports
    reportedUserId?: string,  // For profile reports
    // ... rest of fields
  }
  ```

  - Reset user `reportsCount` to 0
  - Change status back to `active` (unhide profile)
  - Send notification: "Profile Restored"
  
  **2. Warn User:**
  - Create warning in `warnings` collection

  ```
  "Your account has been removed/banned.
  Reason: [banReason]
  You can appeal this decision until [appealDeadline].
  [Appeal Button]"
  ```
- [ ] Create appeal submission form:
  - Textarea for explanation
  - Submit creates entry in `appeals` collection
  - Shows "Appeal submitted, pending review"
- [ ] Admin appeals management:
  - `/admin/appeals` page (separate from reports)
  - Shows all pending appeals
  - Actions: Approve (restore) or Reject (permanent ban)
  - Approve ‚Üí Restore account, reset reports
  - Reject ‚Üí Permanent ban + delete all data

---

#### E. Auto-Moderation for User Content (Future)
