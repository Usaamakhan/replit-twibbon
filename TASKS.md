  reportId: string,
  reason: string,
  details: string,
  issuedBy: adminId,
  issuedAt: timestamp,
  acknowledged: boolean,
}
```

**Completed Tasks:**

- ‚úÖ Supports both campaign and profile warnings
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Admin warning history view (deferred to future update)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è In-app notification delivery (deferred - see Section 9.2)

---

#### 3. **Remove Campaign/Ban User** Button ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## üìã Future Recommendations & Enhancements

**Purpose:** This section contains potential features, improvements, and enhancements for future development phases. Items here are NOT currently prioritized but may be implemented based on user demand and platform growth.

**Last Updated:** October 09, 2025

---

### Phase 3: Email Notification System

**Priority:** LOW (Optional Secondary Channel)  
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED - Not currently needed

**Overview:**
Email notifications as a secondary notification channel for critical events only. FCM push notifications remain the primary notification method.

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Integrate email service provider (Resend.com recommended)
- [ ] Create email templates for critical notifications:
  - Account banned (with appeal instructions)
  - Appeal deadline reminder (3 days before expiry)
  - Important policy updates
  
- [ ] User email preferences:
  - Opt-in/opt-out toggle in `/profile/settings`
  - Separate from push notification settings
  - Default: Disabled (users must opt-in)
  
- [ ] Email triggers (critical only):
  - Account banned ‚Üí Send email with appeal link
  - Appeal deadline in 3 days ‚Üí Reminder email
  - Appeal approved/rejected ‚Üí Email notification
  
- [ ] Rate limiting:
  - Max 3 emails per day per user
  - Batch multiple events into single digest email
  - Avoid spam and email fatigue

**Why Deferred:**
- FCM push notifications cover all use cases
- Email adds complexity and cost
- Most users prefer in-app notifications
- Can be added later if needed

---

### Phase 4: Appeal System UI

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED - Appeal data structure exists, UI pending

**Overview:**
User-facing UI for submitting appeals when content is removed or account is banned. Admin UI for reviewing and approving/rejecting appeals.

**Backend (Partially Complete):**
- ‚úÖ Appeals collection structure defined
- ‚úÖ `appealDeadline` tracked in campaigns and user profiles
- ‚úÖ `appealCount` tracked for campaigns
- ‚è∏Ô∏è API routes for appeal submission
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Admin API for appeal review

**Frontend (Pending):**
- [ ] Create `/appeal-ban/page.js`:
  - Show ban message with reason
  - Display appeal deadline countdown
  - Appeal submission form (explain why it should be restored)
  - Submit appeal button
  - Confirmation message after submission

- [ ] Create `/campaign/[slug]/appeal/page.js`:
  - Show removal reason
  - Display appeal deadline countdown
  - Appeal form for campaign restoration

- [ ] Create `/admin/appeals/page.js`:
  - List all pending appeals
  - Filter by type (Campaign / Account)
  - View appeal details with original report context
  - Approve/Reject buttons with admin notes
  - Track appeal history

**API Routes Needed:**
- [ ] POST `/api/appeals/submit` - User submits appeal
- [ ] GET `/api/admin/appeals` - Admin fetches all appeals
- [ ] PATCH `/api/admin/appeals/[appealId]` - Admin approve/reject

**Business Logic:**
- Appeals must be submitted before `appealDeadline` (30 days)
- Campaigns can appeal max 2 times (tracked in `appealCount`)
- Accounts can appeal once per ban
- After appeal rejected ‚Üí permanent removal/ban
- After 30 days with no appeal ‚Üí automatic permanent removal

---

### Phase 5: Auto-Deletion Cron Jobs

- [ ] Permanently delete:
  - Campaign images from Supabase Storage
  - Campaign documents from Firestore
  - User profile data and all associated campaigns
- [ ] Update status to `removed-permanent` or `banned-permanent`
- [ ] Send final notification (if user still has valid tokens)
