Added Supabase security validations: file size limits (5MB campaigns), file type validation (PNG/JPG/WEBP), and robust validation checks. Updated: `upload-url/route.js` and `campaign-upload-url/route.js`.

---

### Bug Fixes
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (October 02, 2025)

Built two-step upload pages for frames (with transparency detection) and backgrounds (multi-format). Includes delayed authentication, form state preservation, slug generation, and Supabase upload integration. Files: `/create/frame/page.js` and `/create/background/page.js`.

---

### Prerequisites & Utilities
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed (October 01-02, 2025)

Implemented core utilities and backend functions:
- `getCampaignBySlug()` in `firestore.js` - Fetch campaigns by URL slug

- Renamed `createdBy` ‚Üí `creatorId` throughout codebase
- Created `reports` collection with full CRUD functions
- Updated security rules for campaign creation/editing validation
