# Twibbonize - Pending Tasks & Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025 (Documentation Cleanup)  
**Platform:** Next.js 15 + Firebase + Supabase + ImageKit.io  
**Deployment:** Vercel (all testing/deployment happens there, Replit for code editing only)

---

## üìã Overview

This document tracks **unimplemented features only**. All completed features are documented in:
- `replit.md` - Project overview and architecture
- `CAMPAIGN_SYSTEM.md` - Campaign system documentation
- `REPORT_SYSTEM.md` - Reporting and moderation system
- `CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete codebase structure

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Core campaign system (creation, usage, gallery)
- ‚úÖ Admin moderation dashboard (reports, campaigns, users, analytics, appeals, logs)
- ‚úÖ In-app notification system with Firestore (mandatory for all users)
- ‚úÖ Notification inbox at `/profile/notifications` (read/unread, filter, delete)
- ‚úÖ Email notifications for bans/unbans (MailerSend)
- ‚úÖ Appeal system (user submission + admin review)
- ‚úÖ Automated cron jobs (appeal cleanup, reminders)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Advanced analytics (deferred to future)

**Note on Notification Settings:**
- ‚ùå `/settings` and `/settings/notifications` are **NOT NEEDED** and will not be implemented
- **Rationale:** All notifications are moderation-related (warnings, removals, bans, appeals) and users must receive them
- Users already have full notification management via the inbox at `/profile/notifications`
- Optional notification preferences would create confusion and may cause users to miss critical moderation actions
