# Twibbonize App - Next.js Project

## Overview
This is a Next.js 15 application with React 19 and Tailwind CSS, designed to work in the Replit environment. The project was successfully imported from GitHub and configured for optimal performance in Replit's proxy environment.

## üéØ CORE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION & USER FLOW
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: All development decisions must align with this user flow specification ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### User Types & Core Philosophy
The website "Frame" (Twibbonize) is designed around **accessibility for everyone** with two distinct user types:

#### **Visitors (Non-authenticated Users) - Primary Focus**
- **Discovery**: Homepage displays public gallery of trending frames, filterable by time periods and country
- **Search**: Global search functionality to find specific frames 
- **Frame Selection**: Click any frame to view its dedicated page with full details
- **Usage**: Upload personal photos and automatically overlay frames onto them
- **Download**: Download final framed photos **WITHOUT requiring account creation** - completely seamless experience
- **Analytics Access**: View public analytics for any frame (usage stats, popularity, country data)

#### **Creators (Authenticated Users) - Secondary Focus**  
- **Account Creation**: Required ONLY for uploading custom frames (not for using existing frames)
- **Frame Upload**: Access dedicated upload page with frame design, naming, descriptions, and tagging
- **Frame Management**: Personal dashboard to view, edit, delete uploaded frames and track performance
- **Public Profile**: Creator profiles with their uploaded frames and statistics

### Core Features (Implementation Priority)
1. **Public Gallery** (Primary Feature)
   - Heart of the website - displays all publicly available frames
   - All content and analytics are completely public and accessible without accounts
   - Primary visitor interaction point

2. **Frame Analytics** (Key Differentiator)
   - **Completely public** usage statistics for transparency
   - Track: number of uses, downloads, popularity over time, country-based metrics
   - Creates engaging, transparent community environment

3. **Trending & Top Creators**
   - Highlight most popular frames and successful creators
   - Rankings based on actual usage data
   - Motivates quality content creation

4. **User Accounts** (Creators Only)
   - Streamlined system focused on content creation and management tools
   - Keep simple - only essential features for frame uploading and management

### Development Guidelines Based on User Flow
- **Visitor Experience Priority**: Any feature should work for non-authenticated users first
- **Minimal Account Requirements**: Never require accounts unless absolutely necessary (only for frame uploads)
- **Public-First Design**: All analytics, trending, and discovery features must be publicly accessible
- **Seamless Frame Usage**: Photo upload ‚Üí frame overlay ‚Üí download should be frictionless for visitors

## Project Architecture

- **Domain Configuration**: Add your production domain to Firebase Console authorized domains
- **Build Verified**: Production build passes successfully with only non-blocking warnings

## User Preferences
- Prefer stability over experimental features
- Focus on compatibility with Replit environment
- Maintain clean, working codebase structure
