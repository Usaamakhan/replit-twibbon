9. **GitHub Import Setup**: COMPLETE - Application is ready for development and external service configuration
10. **Import Process Completed**: All systems verified working, deployment configured, application fully operational in Replit environment
11. **Final Import Setup (Current Session)**: Re-installed all dependencies, updated domain configuration, verified Next.js server running successfully on port 5000, configured deployment settings for production
11. **Profile Edit Modal Navigation Fixed**: Removed automatic navigation to username page after profile changes - users now stay on current page after editing
12. **Debug Logging Cleanup**: Removed all debug console.log statements from WelcomePopup, ProfileEditModal, and UserOnboardingWrapper for cleaner codebase
13. **Global Popup Visibility**: Moved AuthGate (email verification) and UserOnboardingWrapper (welcome popup) to root layout level - these critical onboarding flows now appear on all pages, not just homepage

## Firebase Setup Status - FULLY CONFIGURED âœ…
